# Linked List

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are connected using pointers. Each node contains two parts:
1. **Data**: The value stored in the node.
2. **Pointer**: A reference to the next node in the sequence.

Linked Lists are dynamic in nature, meaning they can grow or shrink in size during runtime. They are widely used in scenarios where frequent insertion and deletion operations are required.

# Types of Linked Lists
1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node in the sequence. The last node points to `null`.
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node contains two pointers, one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node.
3. **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure. This can be implemented in both singly and doubly linked lists.

By far we have only covered Singly Linked Lists in this repository.
